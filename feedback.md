Ask clarifying questions? 	
Write down inputs and outputs? 	 
Consider edge cases? 	
Use technical language correctly? 
Explain their solution clearly, including summarizing the code from input to output? 	
Correctly solve the problem? 	

Speak in a clear and easy to understand voice? If you are a remote student, did you ensure that your mic is working correctly and check in to make sure the interviewer understands you? 	
Make eye contact? 	
Make good use of whiteboard space and use legible handwriting? If you are a remote student, did you ensure that you are correctly screen-sharing your code?

What did the interviewee do well?
-asked good questions
-constantly verbalized the thought process, didn't stop working

What could be improved?
jumped around in the code a lot. switched from writing pseudocode to actual code to initializing new variables & was hard to follow the logical leaps there when hopping back&forth in the code.

What did the interviewee do well?
explained their thought process well, demonstrated knowledge of each line/step of code
pseudocoded a solution before coding
stepped through code with multiple inputs
handled additional question/restrictions well

What could be improved?
diction wasn't always clear (could have been due to technical issues.)
